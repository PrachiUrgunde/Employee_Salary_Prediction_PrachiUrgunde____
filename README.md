💼 Employee Salary Prediction
A sleek and interactive machine learning web application that predicts whether an individual's salary is more than 50K or not based on their demographic and employment attributes. Built using **Streamlit** and deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**.

📊 Project Overview
This project uses the **UCI Adult Income dataset** to build a classification model that predicts whether an employee earns **more than $50K** annually. It uses features like:

- Age
- Workclass
- Education
- Occupation
- Sex
- Hours per week
- Capital Gain
- Capital Loss

 🖥️ Features

- 📈 Predict salary class using a trained ML model
- 🎨 Transparent input fields with blurred background UI
- ⚙️ Gradient Boosting Classifier for high accuracy
- 🌐 Streamlit Cloud deployment for global access
- 📁 Easily extendable and modular code structure
